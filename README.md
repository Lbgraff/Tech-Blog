# Tech-Blog

## Description

My motivation was to learn about the Model-View-Controller paradigm.

I built this project in order to gain experience with MVC and the other skills we have learned so far such as APIs and databases.

This application solves the issue of the need for a tech blog application where users can sign into their accounts and view/create blogposts.

I learned about MVC as well as other backend technologies that were helpful in making the Tech-Blog app.

## Installation

In order to start the application, the user will sign into their PostgreSQL account through the integrated terminal. Then they will install the schema. They will run the seeds and then run npm start. They will need to go into the browser and run the local host from port 3001.

They may also run the deployed application through Render.
